   - Entry point: main.tsx

4. INFRASTRUCTURE & DEVOPS
   - Docker: 10 Dockerfiles across 3 services (dev, prod, ci)
   - Docker Compose: 3 configurations (dev, prod, vps)
   - GitHub Actions: 7 CI/CD workflows
   - Infrastructure as Code: Terraform, Kubernetes, monitoring configs

5. DATABASE
   - MongoDB: 17 collections fully documented
   - 37 indexes mapped
   - Schema reference: specs/02-design/2.2-database/DB-SCHEMA.md

ARCHITECTURE FLOW DOCUMENTED
=============================

✓ Startup flow (all 3 services)
✓ Trade execution flow (frontend → API → engine → DB → WebSocket → frontend)
✓ AI signal generation flow (market data → strategy → Rust API → Python AI → broadcast)
✓ API routes (48+ endpoints across Rust and Python)
✓ Module dependencies and imports

KEY STATISTICS
==============

Total Source Files: 600+
Total Tests: 2,202+
Total LOC: 50,000+
Code Quality: 94/100 (Grade A)
Security: 98/100 (A+)
Test Coverage: 90.4%
Mutation Score: 84%

SERVICE PORTS
=============

Frontend: 3000 (Vite)
Rust API: 8080 (Actix-web)
Python AI: 8000 (FastAPI)
MongoDB: 27017
Redis: 6379

CRITICAL PATHS MAPPED
====================

1. Rust Startup → Config → Storage → Services → API Server
2. Frontend Login → Auth Context → Dashboard → WebSocket → Real-time updates
3. Trade Execution → Risk Checks → Paper Trading Engine → DB → WebSocket broadcast
4. AI Signal → Market Data → Strategy Engine → Python AI Service → broadcast

TECHNOLOGY STACK DOCUMENTED
============================

Backend:   Rust 1.86 + Tokio + Actix-web + MongoDB
AI/ML:     Python 3.11 + FastAPI + TensorFlow + PyTorch + GPT-4
Frontend:  React 18 + TypeScript + Vite + Shadcn/UI + TailwindCSS

NEXT STEPS FOR DEVELOPMENT
===========================

1. Use scout-01-codebase-structure.md as reference for:
   - Finding relevant files for any feature
   - Understanding module organization
   - API endpoint documentation
   - Database schema

2. Key entry points for new developers:
   - Rust: rust-core-engine/src/main.rs (214 lines, well-commented)
   - Python: python-ai-service/main.py (starting point for AI features)
   - Frontend: nextjs-ui-dashboard/src/App.tsx (root component)

3. Use /specs/ directory for requirements before coding
4. Use /docs/ directory for operational guides
5. Follow workflow documented in CLAUDE.md
