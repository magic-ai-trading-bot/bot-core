ONLY alert if: daily loss exceeds 3% of portfolio, paper trading stopped unexpectedly, or any critical issue detected. If everything is normal, respond with exactly 'RISK_OK' and nothing else - do NOT send any notification. If alerting, send URGENT notification to Telegram using `botcore send_telegram_notification '{{\"message\":\"\\ud83d\\udea8 RISK ALERT: <what triggered, severity, recommended action>\"}}'`. Be urgent and specific."
