ONLY alert if: daily loss exceeds 3% of portfolio, paper trading stopped unexpectedly, or any critical issue detected. If everything is normal, respond with exactly 'RISK_OK' and nothing else - do NOT message the user. If alerting, be urgent: what triggered the alert, severity, and recommended action."
