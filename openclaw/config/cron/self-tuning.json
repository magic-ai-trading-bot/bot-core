  "prompt": "Daily self-tuning analysis. Use botcore CLI to: 1) `botcore get_tuning_dashboard` for performance + settings. 2) `botcore get_parameter_bounds` for current ranges and cooldowns. 3) `botcore get_adjustment_history '{{\"limit\":5}}'` for recent changes. Based on data: A) For GREEN params where data strongly supports a change, apply with `botcore apply_green_adjustment '{{...}}'` and report what changed and why. Maximum 2 GREEN auto-adjustments. B) For YELLOW params with improvement opportunity, present the suggestion with data to the user for confirmation. C) Only mention RED params if critical. Always explain reasoning with numbers. IMPORTANT: After analysis, send a summary to Telegram using `botcore send_telegram_notification '{{\"message\":\"\\ud83d\\udd27 Self-Tuning Report:\\n<summary of changes and recommendations>\"}}'`. Do NOT skip this step."
